Inclusion criteria (ALL are required):\n\na. Acute (< 6 weeks) or subacute (6-12 weeks) osteoporotic VCF (T1 – L5) based on\n\nsymptom onset, and documented by advanced imaging  (bone marrow edema on\n\nMRI or bone-scan/SPECT/CT uptake) \n\nb. Symptomatic (ONE):\n\ni. Hospitalized with severe pain (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) or Visual Analog\n\nScale (VAS) pain score ≥ 8) \n\nii. Non-hospitalized with moderate to severe pain (NRS or VAS ≥5) despite\n\noptimal non-surgical management (NSM) (ONE):\n\n1. Worsening pain\n\n2. Stable to improved pain (but NRS or VAS still ≥5) (with ≥ 2 of the\n\nfollowing):\n\nA. Progression of vertebral body height loss\n\nB. > 25% vertebral body height reduction\n\nC.

All patients with VCF should be instructed to take part in an osteoporosis\n\nprevention/treatment program. \n\n2. Exclusion criteria  (Can have NONE of the following):\n\na. Absolute contraindication\n\ni. Current back pain is not primarily due to the identified acute or subacute\n\nVCF(s).\n\nii. Osteomyelitis, discitis or active systemic or surgical site infection\n\niii. Pregnancy\n\nb. Relative contraindication\n\ni. Greater than three vertebral fractures per procedure\n\nii. Allergy to bone cement or opacification agents\n\niii. Uncorrected Coagulopathy\n\niv. Spinal instability\n\nv. Myelopathy from the fracture\n\nvi. Neurologic deficit\n\nvii.
