now even liquids are coming back up. Hasn't been able to keep anything down for 72 hours. Feels weak and
dizzy. Denies fever. Some pain in upper belly. Says the port area on her abdomen has been bothering her lately
- feels like it shifted or something.
Husband reports she's lost a lot of weight recently but not in a good way - looks gaunt and exhausted.

PAGE 3 - ED IMAGING
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
ORDERED: 03:15
PERFORMED: 04:20
INDICATION: S/p gastric banding, persistent vomiting, eval for obstruction
TECHNIQUE: Axial images acquired after IV contrast
FINDINGS:
Gastric band identiﬁed in expected location around proximal stomach. However, band appears to have
migrated/slipped with signiﬁcant angulation. Marked dilation of esophagus measuring up to 5.2 cm. Stomach
proximal to band markedly distended. Contrast passes slowly through band region.
Port site: Subcutaneous port appears displaced from original position. Surrounding inﬂammatory changes
noted.
Liver: Mildly enlarged with decreased attenuation suggesting steatosis. No focal lesions.
Small bowel: Normal caliber, no obstruction
Large bowel: Unremarkable
No free air, no free ﬂuid
IMPRESSION:
1. Gastric band slippage with malposition causing high-grade outlet obstruction
2. Severe esophageal dilation
3. Port site complications with displacement and surrounding inﬂammation
4. Hepatic steatosis
RECOMMENDATION: Urgent surgical evaluation

TIME: 05:30
PROVIDER: Anderson, Rebecca MD - General Surgery (on call)
CONSULTED FOR: Gastric band complications
HPI


HPI:
Called to ED to see this 40yo woman who had adjustable gastric banding done elsewhere around 5 years ago
(2020). Per patient, she did really well initially - lost signiﬁcant weight, felt great. Band adjustments were done
periodically. However, she moved here about 18 months ago and didn't establish care with a bariatric surgeon
locally. Started having issues with reﬂux about a year ago, managed with OTC PPIs. Progressive dysphagia
over past 2 months, now in acute distress with inability to tolerate PO intake and dehydration.
Reviewed CT - clear band slippage with esophageal dilation and obstruction. This is a known complication of
adjustable banding. Port also appears problematic.
EXAM:
Ill-appearing, dehydrated. Abd exam notable for port site tenderness and abnormal positioning of port.
ASSESSMENT:
Gastric band complication - band slippage causing obstruction. This is surgical emergency requiring band
removal. Given esophageal dilation and patient's overall status, recommend band removal without immediate
conversion to another procedure. Can consider staged approach with conversion later once recovered.
PLAN:
1. Admit to surgery service
2. NPO, IVF, correct electrolytes
3. Schedule for urgent band removal in AM
4. Discussed risks with patient and husband - understand this is complication of original surgery requiring
intervention

PAGE 6 - OPERATIVE REPORT
DATE OF SURGERY: October 16, 2025
SURGEON: Anderson, Rebecca MD
ASSISTANT: Chen, David MD
ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Gastric band slippage with obstruction
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Same, plus band erosion into gastric wall
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Laparoscopic removal of gastric band and port system
INDICATIONS:
Patient with history of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding performed in 2020 presenting with acute
obstruction due to band slippage. Imaging shows malpositioned band. Requires emergent removal.
FINDINGS:
Upon laparoscopic exploration, gastric band found slipped signiﬁcantly with prolapse of stomach through band.
Band severely angulated. Upon mobilization, noted that band had partially eroded through gastric wall
posteriorly - approximately 30% circumference embedded in gastric tissue. Signiﬁcant inﬂammatory reaction
surrounding band. Esophagus markedly dilated. Port tubing intact but port displaced subcutaneously.
PROCEDURE DETAILS:
[Standard operative technique details omitted for brevity]
Band successfully removed along with all tubing and port components Gastric wall defect from erosion


Band successfully removed along with all tubing and port components. Gastric wall defect from erosion
repaired primarily with 3-0 vicryl suture in two layers. No leak on methylene blue test. Hemostasis achieved.
Drains placed. Fascia and skin closed.
EBL: 75mL
SPECIMENS: Gastric band and port system
COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperative
DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition

PAGE 8 - POST-OP FOLLOW-UP VISIT
DATE: November 2, 2025 (2 weeks post-op)
PROVIDER: Anderson, Rebecca MD
INTERVAL HISTORY:
Patient doing much better since band removal. Tolerating regular diet without difﬁculty. No more vomiting. No
dysphagia. Incisions healing well. Still feels weak but improving. Concerned about weight - has continued to
lose weight since surgery, now down to 158 lbs.
CURRENT WEIGHT: 158 lbs
HEIGHT: 64 inches (5'4")
BMI: 27.1
PHYSICAL EXAM:
GENERAL: Thin woman, appears somewhat malnourished
VITALS: BP 132/84, HR 76
ABDOMEN: Incisions well-healed. Soft, non-tender. No masses.
LABS FROM TODAY:
Albumin: 3.3 (improving)
Hemoglobin: 11.1 (improving)
Glucose: 118 (fasting)
A1C: 6.1%
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:


Doing well from surgical standpoint. Band removal successful. However, patient has several ongoing issues:
1. Nutritional deﬁciency - improving but needs continued monitoring. Referral to dietitian.
2. Weight trajectory concerning - patient has lost 30+ lbs in unhealthy manner over past few months due to
band complications. Prior to that, she had regained about 30 lbs from her nadir weight after initial band
placement.
3. Recurrence of metabolic issues - blood sugars trending up (was told prediabetes before, numbers conﬁrm),
BP elevated today.
4. Patient asking about revision surgery - wants to consider conversion to another bariatric procedure as she's
concerned about weight regain. Explained need to recover ﬁrst, optimize nutrition, then can reassess in
future.
PLAN:
Continue current medications
Nutrition follow-up scheduled
Will see back in 6 weeks
Can discuss revisional surgery options once medically optimized
PAGE 9 - NUTRITION FOLLOW-UP
DATE: December 15, 2025
PROVIDER: Williams, Sandra RD - Registered Dietitian
NUTRITION ASSESSMENT:
Patient referred post gastric band removal for nutritional optimization and guidance. She's interested in
pursuing another weight loss surgery once cleared.
WEIGHT HISTORY: Per patient report:
Pre-band surgery weight (2020): 268 lbs, BMI 46
Lowest weight post-band (2022): 188 lbs, BMI 32.3 - excellent result
Started regaining weight 2023: back up to 218 lbs by early 2024
Current weight: 162 lbs (lost dramatically d/t band complications)
So essentially, she lost 80 lbs with band initially (30% total body weight loss), regained 30 lbs, then lost 56 lbs
in unhealthy manner due to obstruction.
DIETARY RECALL


DIETARY RECALL:
Currently eating 3 meals daily. Appetite improved since band removal. Portions still smaller than pre-surgery.
Protein intake adequate. Taking vitamins as prescribed.
CONCERNS:
Patient worried about continued weight regain now that she can eat normally again. Already gained 4 lbs since
last visit (was 158, now 162). Says she "knows herself" and without the restriction, she'll gain all the weight
back. That's why she's very motivated for revision surgery.
COMORBIDITY STATUS: Reviewing records:
Blood sugar issues have returned - A1C was 6.1% at last visit (prediabetic range)
BP running high again - was on meds before initial surgery, needed them again
Reports reﬂux symptoms ongoing despite PPI
ASSESSMENT:
Patient is appropriate candidate for revision bariatric surgery consideration once medically cleared. Has history
of:
Signiﬁcant initial weight loss with prior procedure (30% TBWL)
Weight regain of portion of lost weight
Surgical complication requiring band removal
Recurrence of comorbid conditions
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Continue current dietary plan. Scheduled for monthly follow-ups to monitor weight and nutrition status.
Discussed that most insurance require 6 months documented weight management for revision procedures.
Patient agreeable to continued program participation.
PAGE 10 - BARIATRIC SURGERY REVISION CONSULTATION
DATE: May 10, 2026
PROVIDER: Martinez, Joseph MD - Bariatric Surgery
LOCATION: Regional Bariatric Center
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Revision bariatric surgery consultation
HPI:
41yo woman presents for evaluation of revision bariatric surgery. She underwent laparoscopic adjustable
gastric banding in 2020 at outside facility for morbid obesity (BMI 46) Initial results were excellent
lost 80


gastric banding in 2020 at outside facility for morbid obesity (BMI 46). Initial results were excellent - lost 80
lbs reaching BMI of 32. However, developed band complications including slippage and erosion requiring
removal in October 2025 by Dr. Anderson. Since band removal, she has gained 26 lbs over 6 months. Currently
weighs 188 lbs.
WEIGHT TRAJECTORY:
Pre-initial surgery (2020): 268 lbs, BMI 46
Nadir post-band (2022): 188 lbs, BMI 32.3
Pre-band removal (2024): 218 lbs, BMI 37.4 (regained)
Immediately post-removal (2025): 162 lbs, BMI 27.8 (lost d/t complications)
Current (2026): 188 lbs, BMI 32.3 (regained again)
CURRENT COMORBIDITIES: Patient now has recurrence of metabolic problems:
1. Glucose metabolism issues - A1C today is 6.4% (deﬁnitely prediabetic), fasting glucose 126 (meeting
criteria for diagnosis). Was in better control after initial surgery, worsened with weight regain.
2. Blood pressure problems - currently on amlodipine 5mg and HCTZ, BP today 138/88. Was off meds
completely 2022-2023, restarted 2024.
3. Reﬂux - persistent despite high-dose PPI, likely related to esophageal changes from prior band
complications.
4. Joint pain - knees and back, limiting exercise tolerance.
5. Lipid abnormalities - recent lipid panel shows total cholesterol 232, LDL 156, triglycerides 198, HDL 38.
WEIGHT MANAGEMENT DOCUMENTATION:
Patient has been followed by dietitian monthly since December 2025 (now 6 months documented). Seen by Dr.
Thompson (PCP) monthly as well for weight management program. Records provided show consistent
attendance, dietary counseling, exercise recommendations. Despite adherence, gaining weight steadily -
average 4-5 lbs per month.
PREVIOUS SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS:
Band slippage and erosion (10/2025) - serious complication requiring removal. Operative report reviewed
showing signiﬁcant erosion requiring repair of gastric wall. Patient recovered well from removal surgery.
ASSESSMENT:
This is a revision case. Patient previously underwent LAGB with initial success but developed signiﬁcant
surgical complication (band slippage and erosion) requiring removal. Now experiencing:
Weight regain approaching pre-initial surgery levels


Recurrence of multiple comorbidities (impaired fasting glucose/prediabetes, HTN, dyslipidemia, reﬂux,
arthropathy)
Failure to maintain weight loss after band removal despite 6 months documented medical management
Anatomic issues from prior surgery (esophageal changes, gastric wall scarring)
Criteria for revision surgery: ✓ Prior bariatric procedure (LAGB 2020) ✓ Surgical complication requiring
intervention (band removal 2025)
✓ Weight regain with recurrence of comorbidities ✓ 6+ months documented physician-supervised weight
management post-band removal ✓ BMI 32.3 with multiple comorbidities ✓ Psychological clearance
(scheduled)
DISCUSSION:
Extensively discussed revision options. Given her history and current anatomy:
Sleeve gastrectomy possible but reﬂux is concerning
RYGB likely best option given metabolic beneﬁts and lower reﬂux risk
Higher risk procedure given prior surgery and complications
Will need careful pre-op workup
Patient understands risks including but not limited to: higher complication rate with revision (leak, bleeding,
infection), possibility of need for further surgery, nutritional deﬁciencies, need for lifelong supplementation and
follow-up. Patient motivated and understands this is her "second chance."
PLAN:
1. Pre-op labs, EGD, psych clearance, cardiac clearance
2. Submit for authorization for revision RYGB
3. Continue medical weight management pending surgery
4. Multidisciplinary team review
MEDICAL NECESSITY STATEMENT:
Patient meets criteria for revision bariatric surgery. Previous procedure failed due to surgical complication
(band erosion/slippage) requiring explantation. Now has recurrent obesity (BMI 32.3) with multiple recurrent
comorbidities including impaired glucose metabolism progressing toward diabetes, hypertension requiring
medications, dyslipidemia, and reﬂux. Has completed 6 months supervised medical weight management
program without success at maintaining weight loss. Revision surgery is medically necessary to address
recurrent obesity and prevent progression of metabolic disease.

INFERENCE CHALLENGES IN THIS CASE:
1. Weight calculations scattered across timeline - requires tracking BMI changes over multiple years
2. Comorbidity terminology variations:
"Blood sugar issues" / "prediabetic" / "impaired fasting glucose" / "glucose metabolism issues" →
Type 2 Diabetes/Prediabetes
"Blood pressure problems" / "HTN" → Hypertension
"Reﬂux" / "heartburn" → GERD
3. Surgical complication evidence spread across multiple documents (ED, imaging, operative report)
4. Weight management documentation scattered across nutrition and PCP notes
5. Time intervals requiring calculation from various dates
6. Revision criteria must be inferred from: prior surgery + complication + weight regain + comorbidity
recurrence + documented management
7. Lab values requiring interpretation (A1C 6.4% = prediabetes, fasting glucose 126 = diabetes threshold)
8. No explicit statement of "meets criteria" until ﬁnal note - agent must determine eligibility from scattered
evidence
