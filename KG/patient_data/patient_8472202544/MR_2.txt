FINDINGS:
Liver: Increased echogenicity consistent with hepatic steatosis (fatty inﬁltration). No focal lesions. No
biliary dilatation.
Gallbladder: Normal, no stones
Pancreas: Limited visualization due to body habitus
Spleen: Normal size
Kidneys: Normal size bilaterally, no hydronephrosis
IMPRESSION: Hepatic steatosis consistent with fatty liver

STUDY TYPE: Overnight polysomnography
CLINICAL INDICATION: Loud snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness
RESULTS:
Total sleep time: 5.2 hours
Sleep efﬁciency: 68%
AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index): 32 events/hour [SEVERE]
Lowest O2 saturation: 82%
Average O2 saturation: 91%
Signiﬁcant desaturations noted during REM sleep
Position-dependent, worse supine

FINDINGS:
LV size: Normal
LV wall thickness: Mildly increased (mild LVH)
LV systolic function: Normal, EF estimated 55-60%
RV: Normal size and function
Valves: Trivial MR, otherwise normal
No pericardial effusion
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy, preserved systolic function
PAGE 5 - CARDIOLOGY CONSULTATION NOTE
DATE: March 12, 2025
PROVIDER: Patel, Rajesh MD - Cardiology
REASON FOR CONSULT: Atypical chest pain, abnormal stress test
HPI:
Patient referred for eval of chest discomfort. Describes pressure-like sensation in center of chest, occasional,
sometimes with exertion but also at rest. Denies radiation. Associated with some SOB. No syncope.
PAST CARDIAC HISTORY:
Risk factors include HTN, elevated lipids, positive family history, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, impaired glucose
metabolism
CARDIAC EXAM:
Unremarkable as documented
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS REVIEWED:
Stress Test (03/05/2025):
Bruce protocol, 4 minutes 20 seconds
Stopped due to fatigue and dyspnea
Peak HR 142 (82% predicted max)
BP response: 142/88 to 168/92


BP response: 142/88 to 168/92
ECG: No diagnostic ST changes
Nuclear imaging: Small reversible defect inferior wall, likely artifact vs. mild ischemia
ASSESSMENT:
Atypical chest pain in patient with multiple cardiac risk factors. Stress test equivocal. Likely represents demand
ischemia in setting of HTN and LVH. No acute intervention needed at this time.
PLAN:
Continue current cardiac medications
Aggressive risk factor modiﬁcation including weight loss
Consider repeat imaging if symptoms worsen
Cleared for physical activity with gradual increase as tolerated
PAGE 6 - ENDOCRINOLOGY CONSULTATION
DATE: September 28, 2025
PROVIDER: Kumar, Priya MD - Endocrinology
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Uncontrolled hyperglycemia
HPI:
47yo man referred for management of elevated blood sugars. Initially diagnosed about 5 years ago. Was on just
metformin initially but sugars kept creeping up. Added sulfonylurea 2 years ago. Most recent A1C 8.4% which
is above target. Fasting sugars running 140-180s. Postprandial sugars in 200s. Tried to manage with diet and
exercise but struggling with adherence. Weight has been stable to slightly increasing.
EXAMINATION:
Well-appearing obese gentleman
BP 138/86
CV: RRR
Lungs: Clear
Abd: Obese, soft
Extremities: Decreased sensation to monoﬁlament testing bilateral feet, vibration sense diminished at great toes
Skin: Acanthosis nigricans noted posterior neck
LABS REVIEWED:
A1C 8.4% (goal <7%)
Fasting glucose 164


Lipids suboptimal as above
Renal function: Cr 1.1, eGFR 76, microalbuminuria present
Urine shows glucosuria
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
Type 2 DM, inadequately controlled on current oral regimen. Evidence of early microvascular complications
with peripheral neuropathy and microalbuminuria. Also has multiple macrovascular risk factors.
Discussed need for intensiﬁcation of therapy. Options include adding another oral agent, GLP-1 agonist, or
insulin. Given A1C >8%, would typically add basal insulin but patient reluctant.
Added Jardiance 10mg daily for additional glucose control and renal protection. Increased metformin to max
dose. Continue current sulfonylurea for now.
Strongly encouraged weight loss - discussed that even 5-10% weight reduction would signiﬁcantly improve
glucose control. Referred to bariatric surgery program given BMI >40 with complications of hyperglycemia.
Will recheck A1C in 3 months. If still elevated, will need to start insulin.

PAGE 10 - SURGICAL ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
DATE: October 10, 2025


PROVIDER: Thompson, Lisa MD - General Surgery
ASSESSMENT:
47-year-old male with class 3 obesity (BMI 42.4) presenting for bariatric surgery evaluation.
RELEVANT MEDICAL COMORBIDITIES:
1. Poorly controlled hyperglycemia - on two oral agents with A1C 8.4%, fasting glucoses 140-180s, has
evidence of end-organ effects including neuropathy and kidney involvement with microalbuminuria
2. Cardiovascular disease - HTN on two medications with BP still elevated, abnormal lipids, mild LVH on
echo, family history of early cardiac death, equivocal stress test suggesting possible ischemia
3. Severe sleep-disordered breathing - polysomnography showing AHI 32 with signiﬁcant desaturations, on
CPAP therapy
4. Hepatic steatosis - ultrasound conﬁrmed fatty inﬁltration with elevated liver enzymes
5. Degenerative joint disease limiting mobility
SURGICAL HISTORY: None
WEIGHT LOSS HISTORY:
Patient has completed 8 months of comprehensive medically supervised weight management program through
our hospital system. Program included:
Monthly physician visits with Dr. Martinez
Monthly nutritional counseling with registered dietitian
Meal planning and food diary monitoring
Behavioral modiﬁcation strategies
Exercise recommendations and monitoring
Initial weight loss of 15 lbs but plateau for past 4 months despite continued adherence
CLEARANCES:
Cardiology: Cleared for surgery (Dr. Patel 3/12/25)
Psychology: Cleared for surgery (Dr. Roberts 10/5/25)
Nutrition: Completed education and assessment
DISCUSSION:
Extensive discussion with patient regarding bariatric surgery options including risks, beneﬁts, alternatives.
Discussed laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Given his signiﬁcant metabolic
derangements particularly the uncontrolled hyperglycemia with complications, would favor RYGB for superior


metabolic outcomes.
Risks discussed including but not limited to: bleeding, infection, leak, stricture, obstruction, nutritional
deﬁciencies requiring lifelong supplementation, need for adherence to dietary restrictions, potential for
inadequate weight loss or weight regain, need for possible revision surgery, DVT/PE, cardiac events, death.
Patient verbalizes understanding.
Discussed that surgery is a tool requiring lifelong commitment to dietary modiﬁcations, vitamin
supplementation, exercise, and follow-up. Patient appears to understand and is motivated.
PLAN:
1. Recommend laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
2. Will submit for insurance authorization
3. Patient to complete pre-operative education classes
4. Optimize medical management pre-operatively
5. Schedule surgery pending authorization
MEDICAL NECESSITY DOCUMENTATION:
Patient meets criteria with BMI >40 with multiple severe comorbidities including uncontrolled hyperglycemia
with microvascular complications, cardiovascular disease with LVH and abnormal lipids, severe sleep apnea,
and fatty liver disease. Has completed >6 months physician-supervised weight management program with
documented monthly visits, nutritional counseling, and behavioral modiﬁcation without sustained weight loss.
Psychological evaluation completed and cleared. This patient is an appropriate candidate for bariatric surgery.
