WEIGHT MANAGEMENT HISTORY: Documented participation in comprehensive medically supervised
program for 10 months (12/2024-09/2025) with consistent monthly attendance. Lost only 8 lbs despite
adherence. Multiple specialists have recommended weight loss as critical intervention.
CLEARANCES NEEDED:
Cardiology clearance (high-risk given EF 35-40%)
Psychology clearance (history of depression with past SI)
Nephrology input (CKD Stage 3B - surgery may stress kidneys further)
PHYSICAL EXAM: VITALS: BP 134/82, HR 74, RR 16, O2 Sat 95% RA
GENERAL: Obese woman, pleasant, NAD
CARDIOVASCULAR: RRR, S3 present, JVP normal today
RESPIRATORY: CTAB, no distress
ABDOMEN: Obese, soft, non-tender, well-healed surgical scars (prior C-sections)
EXTREMITIES: Trace edema today
NEURO: Decreased sensation feet bilaterally
ASSESSMENT:
Complex 53yo woman with severe obesity (BMI 42.9) and MULTIPLE serious comorbidities:
Advanced diabetes with microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy)
Cardiovascular disease (prior MI, chronic HF with reduced EF)
CKD Stage 3B with declining function
Severe OSA
Poorly controlled HTN
Dyslipidemia
Depression
Patient has participated in comprehensive medically supervised weight management program for >6 months
with documented adherence but minimal success (3.1% weight loss). Taking 23 medications daily for obesity-
related conditions.
CONCERNS:
1. Cardiac risk: EF 35-40% increases surgical risk signiﬁcantly
2. Renal function: eGFR 38 - surgery may worsen kidney function


y
y
y
3. Psychological: History of depression with suicidal ideation
4. CPAP non-compliance: Concerning for post-op compliance
This is a HIGH-RISK but potentially HIGH-BENEFIT case.
Without intervention, patient's trajectory is dialysis, further cardiac decline, possible blindness from
retinopathy. But surgery carries signiﬁcant risks given comorbidities.
PLAN:
1. Obtain cardiology clearance - will need stress test, optimize HF management
2. Psychology evaluation - assess current mental status, surgical readiness
3. Nephrology consultation regarding surgical risk
4. Comprehensive pre-op medical optimization
5. Multidisciplinary team conference
6. If cleared, recommend Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (metabolic beneﬁts for diabetes)
MEDICAL NECESSITY: Patient meets criteria for bariatric surgery:
BMI >40 (42.9)
Multiple severe obesity-related comorbidities
Failed >6 months medically supervised weight loss program
Medically necessary to prevent further deterioration
However, must ensure patient can safely undergo surgery given cardiac and renal status. Will proceed with
clearances and optimization.
PAGE 11 - CARDIOLOGY CLEARANCE FOR SURGERY
DATE: November 5, 2025
PROVIDER: Martinez, Elena MD - Cardiology
RE: Pre-operative clearance for bariatric surgery
ASSESSMENT:
Patient with known CAD s/p PCI, chronic systolic HF (EF 35-40%) requesting clearance for bariatric surgery.
ADDITIONAL TESTING PERFORMED:
Stress Test (Nuclear):


Modiﬁed Bruce protocol
Stopped at 4 minutes due to fatigue and dyspnea
Peak HR 128 (75% max predicted)
BP response: 134/82 to 156/88
No chest pain
No diagnostic ECG changes
Nuclear imaging: Fixed defect in LAD territory (old MI), no new reversible ischemia
Updated Echo (11/2025):
EF 38% (unchanged)
Moderate LVH
Mild MR
No signiﬁcant change from prior
IMPRESSION: High-risk surgical candidate due to reduced EF and HF history. However, no evidence of
active ischemia. Patient medically optimized on appropriate HF regimen.
CLEARANCE: Patient cleared for bariatric surgery with following recommendations:
Perioperative beta-blockade (already on carvedilol)
Careful ﬂuid management given HF
ICU monitoring post-operatively
Aggressive DVT prophylaxis
Close cardiac monitoring
Beneﬁts of signiﬁcant weight loss (reduced cardiac workload, improved metabolic proﬁle) may outweigh
surgical risks. Patient understands increased cardiac risk.
CLEARED FOR SURGERY with above precautions.
PAGE 12 - PSYCHOLOGY PRE-OPERATIVE EVALUATION
DATE: November 8, 2025
PROVIDER: Anderson, Mark PhD - Clinical Psychology
EVALUATION TYPE: Pre-bariatric surgery psychological assessment


CLINICAL INTERVIEW: Patient presents as cooperative, appropriate. Currently in stable mental health,
denies active depression. Taking sertraline with good effect. Denies current or recent suicidal ideation. Past
hospitalization was 17 years ago in context of difﬁcult divorce - no recent psychiatric hospitalizations.
UNDERSTANDING OF SURGERY: Patient demonstrates good understanding of bariatric surgery. Able to
articulate:
Surgical risks and beneﬁts
Dietary restrictions post-operatively
Need for vitamin supplementation for life
Importance of follow-up
Lifestyle changes required
Realistic weight loss expectations
EATING BEHAVIORS: No evidence of binge eating disorder. No purging behaviors. Some emotional eating
acknowledged but not pathological. Patient has been working with dietitian and shows improvement in eating
patterns.
MOTIVATION: Highly motivated. Understands surgery is tool, not cure. Concerned about declining health.
Wants to be healthy for grandchildren. Motivated by friend's successful outcome and realistic about her
expectations.
SUPPORT SYSTEM: Divorced but has good support from adult children. Attends church regularly. Has
friend group. Not isolated.
CONCERNS: History of depression with past suicidal ideation is noted, but currently stable. Will need
continued psychiatric follow-up post-operatively. Patient understands and agrees.
COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT: Adequate cognitive function to understand informed consent and post-
operative requirements.
RECOMMENDATION: CLEARED for bariatric surgery from psychological standpoint.
Recommend:
Continue sertraline post-operatively
Close psychiatric follow-up
Monitor for post-operative depression (common after bariatric surgery)
Patient committed to follow-up care


INFERENCE CHALLENGES IN THIS CASE:
1. Must infer diagnoses from medication list:
Lantus + Humalog + Jardiance + Metformin + Glipizide = Type 2 DM
Lisinopril + Metoprolol + Amlodipine + Furosemide + Carvedilol = Heart failure + HTN
Aspirin + Plavix = Prior MI/stenting
Atorvastatin + Fenoﬁbrate = Dyslipidemia
Pantoprazole = GERD
Sertraline + Trazodone = Depression
Gabapentin = Neuropathy
2. Conﬂicting weight/height measurements:
PCP: 247 lbs, 64 inches (with shoes, street clothes)
Cardiology: 244 lbs
Endocrinology: 250 lbs, 63 inches (in gown)
Weight program: 248 lbs, 64 inches
Bariatric clinic: 242 lbs, 63 inches (most standardized)
BMI ranges from 41.5 to 43.9 depending on measurements
Must determine which is most accurate
3. Diabetes complications scattered across multiple notes:
Ophthalmology: Retinopathy
Nephrology: Nephropathy, CKD Stage 3B
Neuro exam ﬁndings: Neuropathy
Cardiology: Macrovascular disease (MI)
Must piece together that patient has severe diabetes with multiple end-organ complications
4. Kidney disease progression - Must track creatinine trend and recognize Stage 3B CKD
5. Heart failure severity - Must recognize:
EF 35-40% = reduced EF (HFrEF)
S3 gallop = decompensated HF
NYHA Class II-III symptoms
On guideline-directed medical therapy (ACE-I, beta-blocker, diuretic)
6. Sleep apnea non-compliance - AHI 38 (severe) but poor CPAP adherence
i
i


7. Weight loss program documentation - Calculate % weight loss (3.1%), determine if adequate attempt
8. High surgical risk recognition - Despite meeting criteria, must recognize:
Cardiac risk (low EF)
Renal risk (CKD Stage 3B)
But cleared by specialists with precautions
9. Borderline approval - This case SHOULD be approved but requires careful risk-beneﬁt analysis
10. Time calculations - 10 months program participation (12/2024-09/2025), consultation 10/2025 = meets >6
month requirement
This tests whether AI can:
Reverse-engineer diagnoses from medications
Reconcile conﬂicting measurements
Recognize high-risk but appropriate candidate
Understand that severe comorbidities = both higher risk AND higher medical necessity
