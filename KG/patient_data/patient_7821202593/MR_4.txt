CHIEF COMPLAINT: School physical and weight concerns
HPI:
Miguel here with mom for sports physical. Mom reports he wants to try out for football but she's worried about
his weight. He's been a big kid since elementary school. Kids tease him at school. He's been eating more lately
- growth spurt maybe? Mom tried to get him to diet but he just gets hungry. Eats a lot of fast food.
Patient quiet during visit, lets mom do most of talking. When asked directly, says he'd like to lose weight but
"it's hard."

Asthma - uses inhaler sometimes with exercise
Broke his arm skateboarding last year
MEDICATIONS:
Albuterol inhaler PRN

Mom has "sugar diabetes" - on insulin. Dad has high BP and had heart attack at age 42. Grandma on mom's
side passed away from complications of diabetes. Uncle had gastric bypass surgery few years ago.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
10th grade. Lives with both parents and younger sister. Doesn't play sports currently. Spends time on video


games. Mom works two jobs, dad works nights, so family doesn't eat together much. Lot of takeout and frozen

UA: Glucose 3+, ketones trace, protein 1+
ASSESSMENT:
Hypertensive emergency in obese adolescent with hyperglycemia. Concern for malignant HTN with end-organ
effects (papilledema). New diagnosis diabetes likely.
ED COURSE:
IV access. Cardiology consulted. Pediatric endocrinology consulted. Admitted for BP management and diabetes
workup.
PAGE 5 - HOSPITAL ADMISSION - CARDIOLOGY CONSULT
DATE: February 4, 2026
PROVIDER: Lee, James MD - Pediatric Cardiology
REASON FOR CONSULT: Severe HTN in adolescent
ASSESSMENT:
16yo with severe obesity presenting with hypertensive emergency. BP 168/102 in ED, has come down to
148/90 with IV medications.
ECHO PERFORMED TODAY:
Signiﬁcant LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) - wall thickness markedly increased
LV systolic function preserved, EF 60%
Mild diastolic dysfunction
Tricuspid regurg velocity elevated suggesting pulmonary HTN
IMPRESSION:
End-organ damage from chronic hypertension. This didn't happen overnight - patient has had elevated BP for
some time causing cardiac remodeling. Concerning in someone so young.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Amlodipine 5mg daily


Lisinopril 10mg daily
Close BP monitoring
MUST address underlying obesity - major contributor to HTN
F/u in cardiology clinic
PAGE 6 - HOSPITAL ADMISSION - ENDOCRINOLOGY CONSULT
DATE: February 4, 2026
PROVIDER: Patel, Neha MD - Pediatric Endocrinology
CONSULTED FOR: Hyperglycemia, obesity
HPI:
16yo M admitted with hypertensive emergency, found to have glucose 224. Mom reports he's always been
heavy. Family history strongly positive for T2DM. Patient has acanthosis nigricans, severe obesity.
ADMISSION LABS:
Glucose: 224 (random)
A1C: 8.9% [HIGH - diagnostic for diabetes]
Fasting glucose this AM: 186 mg/dL
C-peptide: 4.2 ng/mL (elevated - indicates insulin resistance, not T1DM)
Islet cell antibodies: Negative
GAD antibodies: Negative
ADDITIONAL LABS I ORDERED:
Lipid panel: Total chol 256, LDL 172, HDL 32, Trig 260
ALT: 89 (elevated)
AST: 76 (elevated)

DIAGNOSIS:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, new onset, uncontrolled
ASSESSMENT:
This patient has severe insulin resistance in setting of morbid obesity. His diabetes is already fairly advanced
based on A1C of 8.9%. Combined with severe HTN causing end-organ damage, this is very concerning for
someone his age


someone his age.
PLAN:
Start metformin 500mg BID, will increase
Diabetes education
STRONGLY recommend comprehensive weight management
Consider bariatric surgery evaluation - I know he's young but this is severe disease

PAGE 9 - CONFLICTING DOCUMENTATION - SCHOOL NURSE NOTE
DATE: March 5, 2026
FROM: Lincoln High School Health Ofﬁce
NURSE: Thompson, Mary RN
RE: Miguel Rodriguez - Health Concerns
TO: Dr. Kim
Dear Dr. Kim,
I wanted to reach out regarding Miguel. He's been coming to health ofﬁce frequently complaining of not feeling
well. I've checked his BP a few times and it's been ranging 138-152 systolic. I know he was hospitalized
recently.
I'm concerned because I've observed him in cafeteria eating large portions and he told me his parents "don't
really care" what he eats. He seems depressed. Other students have made comments about his weight in my
presence.
His gym teacher reports he sits out of activities frequently, says he can't breathe. When I asked about his
inhaler, he said he doesn't have it at school.
I encouraged him to follow up with you. He said his mom keeps canceling appointments because she has to
work.
Please let me know if there's anything I can do to support his health at school.
Regards,
Mary Thompson, RN
PAGE 10 - BARIATRIC SURGERY CONSULTATION (Finally!)
DATE: August 15 2026


DATE: August 15, 2026
PROVIDER: Richardson, Thomas MD - Bariatric Surgery
LOCATION: Children's Hospital Adolescent Bariatric Program
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Evaluation for weight loss surgery
HPI:
17yo M (DOB 2/14/2009) referred by endocrinology for bariatric surgery evaluation. Complex history - has
had severe obesity "his whole life" per family. Recently diagnosed with T2DM and severe HTN with end-organ
complications (LVH, papilledema). Multiple other obesity-related conditions.
GROWTH/DEVELOPMENT: Height: 71 inches (5'11")
Weight today: 294 lbs
BMI: 41.0 (>99th percentile for age)
Tanner Stage: Now Tanner V per exam (mature)
Bone age X-ray (done last month): 16.5 years - appropriate for chronological age. Endocrinology notes growth
plates nearly fused, at ﬁnal adult height.
WEIGHT HISTORY - PIECED TOGETHER FROM RECORDS:
Age 14 (2023, Texas records): 245 lbs
Age 16 (10/2025, Dr. Kim): 278 lbs
Age 16 (2/2026, hospital discharge): 289 lbs
Age 17 (today, 8/2026): 294 lbs
Steady upward trajectory despite multiple interventions.
CURRENT MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
1. T2DM - A1C last month 8.2% (still not controlled despite max dose metformin)
2. Hypertension - on 2 meds, BP today 136/84
3. LVH with diastolic dysfunction
4. Probable pulmonary HTN
5. Dyslipidemia - on statin
6. Fatty liver with elevated enzymes
7. Insulin resistance - severe
8. Likely OSA - family reports snoring, witnessed apneas (sleep study pending - scheduled next week)
9. Orthopedic issues - knee pain, limits mobility


10. Depression - started on sertraline 2 months ago by PCP
MEDICATIONS:
Metformin 1000mg BID
Amlodipine 10mg daily (increased from 5mg)
Lisinopril 20mg daily (increased from 10mg)
Atorvastatin 20mg daily
Sertraline 50mg daily
Albuterol PRN (rarely uses)
WEIGHT MANAGEMENT ATTEMPTS:
This is where it gets complicated...
Per mom: "We've tried so many things over the years"
Multiple diet attempts on own - no documentation
Saw nutritionist "a few times" in Texas - limited records, not recent
After hospitalization (2/2026), referred to Children's Hospital weight management program
Program participation:
Started 3/2026
Initial visits in March, April - attended
Missed May appointment
Came to June appointment
No-show July
Mom states: "It's hard to get there, I work two jobs, it's downtown, parking is expensive"
I called program coordinator - they conﬁrm sporadic attendance. When he does come, family seems engaged,
but follow-through is inconsistent. Patient has not been adherent to dietary recommendations based on food
logs. Only 5 months in program with inconsistent participation.
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION (completed last week by Dr. Santos):
Psychological testing shows:
Mild-moderate depression (now on medication)
Low self-esteem related to weight and bullying
Some family dysfunction - parents have marital stress


y y
Patient has mixed feelings about surgery - says he wants it but also scared
Developmental assessment: Appropriate for age
Cognitive function: Normal
Eating patterns: Some binge eating episodes, emotional eating
Psychologist impression: "Patient has some psychological readiness but family engagement is concerning.
Mother seems ambivalent about surgery. Father more supportive but works nights, less involved in care.
Inconsistent medical follow-up is red ﬂag. Would beneﬁt from more intensive psychological support before
proceeding."
SOCIAL WORK ASSESSMENT:
Social worker met with family. Identiﬁed barriers:
Financial stress - both parents working multiple jobs
Transportation issues - no car, use public transit
Language barriers - parents more comfortable in Spanish, all documents in English
Mother's health literacy lower - doesn't fully understand son's conditions
Family eats out frequently due to work schedules, convenience
TODAY'S VISIT:
Patient seems mature, articulate. Says he understands surgery is "serious" and will "change everything." When I
press on speciﬁcs of post-op diet, vitamin requirements, seems less clear. Mom doing a lot of talking for him.
Dad came today (took day off work). Very concerned about son's health. Says "I don't want him to die young
like my father." More supportive of surgery than mom.
PAGE 11 - MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM CONFERENCE NOTE
DATE: August 16, 2026
ATTENDEES: Dr. Richardson (surgeon), Dr. Patel (endocrinology), Dr. Lee (cardiology), Dr. Santos
(psychology), Social worker, Dietitian
CASE DISCUSSION: Miguel Rodriguez - 17yo male with severe obesity, T2DM, HTN
DEBATE/CONCERNS RAISED:
PRO-SURGERY ARGUMENTS (Dr. Patel, Dr. Lee):
Severe disease at young age - already has end-organ damage


y
g g
y
g
g
BMI >40 (41.0, which is >99th percentile)
Multiple major comorbidities: T2DM poorly controlled despite meds, HTN requiring 2 drugs with LVH,
dyslipidemia, fatty liver
Disease progression rapid despite medical management
Skeletal maturity documented
Surgery may be only way to prevent early death/disability
CONCERNS (Psychology, Social Work, Nutrition):
Inconsistent engagement with weight management program - only 5 months, multiple no-shows
Hasn't truly "failed" comprehensive program due to attendance issues
Psychological readiness questionable
Family dysfunction and ambivalence
Concern about post-op compliance
Social barriers (ﬁnances, transportation) that affect follow-up
SURGEON'S PERSPECTIVE (Dr. Richardson): "I'm conﬂicted. Medically, he's a strong candidate - severe
disease, complications, skeletal maturity. But the program participation is problematic. Policy requires 6
months minimum, and we need consistent engagement, not sporadic attendance. I'm also concerned about post-
op follow-up given current pattern."
TEAM CONSENSUS:
Patient is NOT ready for surgery at this time
Need to address barriers to care ﬁrst
Extend weight management program with better support systems
Re-evaluate in 3-4 months with better documentation
PAGE 12 - SURGEON'S ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
DATE: August 15, 2026
PROVIDER: Richardson, Thomas MD
ASSESSMENT:
17yo male with severe obesity (BMI 41.0, >99th percentile) and multiple serious comorbidities including:
Type 2 diabetes, poorly controlled (A1C 8.2%)


Hypertension with end-organ damage (LVH)
Dyslipidemia
Probable OSA (study pending)
Hepatic steatosis
Depression
Skeletal maturity conﬁrmed (Tanner V, bone age appropriate, at ﬁnal height).
MEDICAL NECESSITY CONSIDERATIONS:
MEETS CRITERIA:
✓ Age appropriate (17, skeletal maturity conﬁrmed)
✓ BMI >35 with major comorbidities (actually >40)
✓ Severe comorbidities (T2DM with poor control, HTN with LVH)
✓ Failed dietary management (weight increasing despite efforts)
✓ Psychological evaluation completed
✓ Multidisciplinary team involved
DOES NOT MEET CRITERIA:
✗ Inadequate documentation of comprehensive weight management program
Only 5 months participation (need 6 minimum)
Inconsistent attendance (multiple no-shows)
Poor adherence to recommendations ✗ Psychological concerns about family engagement and compliance ✗
Social barriers not adequately addressed
DISCUSSION WITH FAMILY:
Had lengthy conversation. Explained that medically, Miguel is very sick and surgery could help. However,
surgery requires lifelong commitment. Need to see better engagement with medical care before proceeding.
Discussed barriers:
Arranged for appointments at satellite clinic closer to home
Connected family with ﬁnancial counselor for assistance with transportation
Arranged Spanish-speaking care coordinator
Referred to more intensive psychological support
PLAN:
1 NOT
i
f
hi
i


1. NOT approving for surgery at this time
2. Continue/restart comprehensive weight management program with better support
3. Address barriers to care
4. Need minimum 6 months CONSISTENT participation with documentation
5. Psychological counseling for patient and family
6. Will re-evaluate in 4-6 months
Explained to family: "Miguel needs this surgery medically, but we need to make sure he can be successful with
it. That means being able to come to appointments, follow the program, and commit to changes. Let's work on
making that possible."
Family disappointed but understanding. Dad especially frustrated - says "you're telling me he's sick enough to
need it but you won't do it." Explained it's not punitive, it's ensuring best outcomes.
IMPRESSION:
Defer bariatric surgery evaluation pending completion of adequate pre-operative preparation and
documentation of program adherence.
INFERENCE CHALLENGES IN THIS CASE:
1. Incomplete/scattered weight history - reconstruct from multiple sources over 3+ years
2. BMI percentiles for adolescents vs. adult BMI calculations
3. Growth/development markers:
Tanner staging progression (IV → V)
Bone age interpretation
"Near ﬁnal height" requires inference from multiple notes
4. Conﬂicting information:
Mother vs. father support
School nurse observations vs. family reports
Attendance records vs. verbal claims
5. Inadequate documentation:
Lost records from Texas
Missed appointments creating gaps
Incomplete weight management program participation


6. Comorbidity terminology requiring inference:
"Sugar problems" → prediabetes → T2DM (progression over time)
"Feeling weird" + papilledema = hypertensive emergency
LVH + diastolic dysfunction = cardiac complications
Elevated liver enzymes + ultrasound = fatty liver/NAFLD
7. Time calculations:
Program participation: 3/2026-8/2026 with gaps
Is 5 months with multiple no-shows sufﬁcient?
8. Psychosocial factors affecting medical necessity determination
9. Must infer DENIAL despite meeting medical criteria due to inadequate documentation
10. Special consideration for adolescent - different criteria than adults
This case tests whether AI can recognize that clinical severity ALONE doesn't guarantee approval -
documentation quality and compliance matter.
