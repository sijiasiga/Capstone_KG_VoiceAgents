Fracture retropulsion/canal compromise\u00a0\u00a0Summary of EvidenceOsteoporosis (and low bone mass) affects 50 percent of people over 50 years of age, or over50 million people in the United States. Its primary impact, fractures (also called fragility orlow-trauma fractures), occurs secondary to normal activity (e.g., bending, coughing, lifting,fall from a standing height), and eventually occurs in 50% of women and 20% of men. VCFsconstitute one-quarter of osteoporotic fractures, often at the midthoracic (T7-T8) andthoracolumbar junction (T12-L1). They may cause significant acute and chronic pain,leading to complications of impaired mobility comparable to a hip fracture (pneumonia, lossof bone and muscle mass, incidental falls, deep venous thrombosis, depression, andisolation). Medicare claims data shows an 85% 10 year mortality following a VCFdiagnosis. Under-diagnosis and under-treatment may exacerbate morbidity andmortality.Treatment options for symptomatic osteoporotic VCF range from NSM (anti-osteoporosistherapy, analgesics, limited activity/bed rest, back brace, physical therapy) to PVA (PVP andPKP). PVP involves the percutaneous injection of bone cement under image guidance intothe VCF. PKP adds balloon tamponade within the fractured vertebral body to create a lowpressure cavity prior to cement injection. Both treatments aimed to immobilize the fracture,reduce pain, and improve alignment.2,5,8-10610111010/10/25, 5:30 PMLCD - Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA) for Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fracture (VCF) (L34106)https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?LCDId=341066/20Successful small European series introduced PVP into the United States in 1993; by 2007encouraging preliminary observational data led to medical society endorsement and clinicalacceptance in painful osteoporotic VCFs refractory to medical management. Subsequentearly open-label randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including the Vertebroplasty for PainfulChronic Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures (VERTOS) trial,the Fracture ReductionEvaluation (FREE) trial,VERTOS II,and others, found a benefit of vertebralaugmentation over non-surgical management.VERTOS II was a multicenter RCT that compared PVP and NSM of acute (< 6 weeks)osteoporotic VCF in patients with moderate to severe pain (VAS\u22655).Among 202 patients,the primary endpoint of pain relief at one month and one year was greater after PVP(-5.2/-5.7) than after NSM (-2.7/-3.7) (p < 0.001). Secondary outcomes, including RDQ andQuality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO),were similarly improved. The main limitation in the VERTOS II trial was the lack of blinding.Subsequent analysis of the medical cohort showed that 60% achieved sufficient (VAS \u2264 3)pain relief, most within 3 months.The authors acknowledged that despite the VERTOS IIresults, \"clinicians still do not know how to best treat their patients, \" but conclude that,pending further RCTs, PVP may be justified in patients with insufficient pain relief after 3months of conservative treatment.The lack of blinding made the early open-label RCTs, vulnerable to placebo effect. However,in 2009, two high profile, methodologically controversial (e.g., non-rigorous patient selection)double-blinded, RCTs found no benefit of PVP over a \"sham\" procedure (pedicle periostealbupivacaine injection).Ever since, there has been a lack of consensus on theappropriate management of osteoporotic VCF, particularly the role of PVA. Medicareclaims data shows that among over 2 million VCF patients, PVA was performed in 20% in2005, peaked at 24% in 2007-2008, and declined to 14% in 2014, a 42% decrease. Lower PVA utilization was associated with a 4% increase in propensity-adjusted mortalityrisk (p < 0.001). A secondary analysis gave a number needed to treat (NNT) at one year tosave a life of 22.8 and 14.8 for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively.Both studiesnoted the potential for selection bias despite propensity scoring. Subsequent major RCTs,described below, have attempted to address the perceived shortcomings of these twonegative studies (primarily more stringent selection criteria and choice of control).The Vertebroplasty for Acute Painful Osteoporotic Fractures (VAPOUR) double-blinded RCTwas designed to compare acute fracture (< 6 weeks) PVP with a sham procedure(subcutaneous, not periosteal, infiltration) for patients with severe pain (NRS \u22657).Among120 randomized patients, the primary endpoint (NRS score < 4 by 14 days) was achieved in44% and 21% of PVP and sham patients, respectively (p = 0.011), and durable to 6 months.Mean height loss at 6 months was 36% greater in the control group (63% vs. 27%). Hospitalinpatients constituted 57% of study patients; among this group, median length of stay wasreduced by 5.5 days in the PVP group. In addition to a focus on the acute, severely painfulVCF, this study also concentrated on delivering greater cement volumes than prior studies.21\u00a022,231414151512,13 6,101126510/10/25, 5:30 PMLCD - Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA) for Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fracture (VCF) (L34106)https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?LCDId=341067/20The authors conclude that PVP is superior to true placebo control of severe pain in VCFs ofless than 6 weeks.VERTOS IV used the same inclusion criteria as VERTOS II, but was a double-blindedcomparison of PVP with a sham procedure (pedicle periosteal infiltration).Among the 180randomized patients, although the reduction in VAS score was clinically (> 1.5 points) andstatistically significant up to 12 months in both groups (5.00 at 12 months in the PVP groupvs. 4.75 in the sham group), reductions in VAS scores did not differ between groups (p =0.48). The authors conclude, \"the results suggest that periosteal infiltration alone in the earlyphase provides enough pain relief with no need for additional cementation.\" Theyrecommend the \"pragmatic approach\" of first use of \"periosteal infiltration during naturalhealing\" and \"cementation only in a selected subgroup of patients with insufficient painrelief after this early phase.\" They also highlight a subgroup that may warrant earlier PVPper the VAPOUR trial (hospital inpatients with more comorbidity and severe pain).The 2018 multicenter, prospective, uncontrolled, EVOLVE study of 354 Medicare-agepatients with acute or subacute (\u2264 4 mo.) painful (NRS \u22657) VCF (all but 8 osteoporotic),found statistical improvement in NRS, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short Form-36Questionnaire Physical Component Summary (SF-36v2 PCS), and EuroQol-5-Domain (EQ-SD) out to 12 months.The authors conclude that \"kyphoplasty is a safe, effective, anddurable procedure for treating patients with painful VCF due to osteoporosis.\"Analysis of Evidence (Rationale for Determination)Whether or when to use PVA for osteoporotic VCF has been very controversial sincepublication of the two negative 2009 RCTs. At the time, some national organizationswithdrew (Australia Medical Services Advisory Committee)or severely curbed (AmericanAcademy of Orthopaedic Surgeons)endorsement. Others continued recommending PVAin select patients. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommendsPVA in patients \"who have severe ongoing pain after a recent, unhealed vertebral fracturedespite optimal pain management and in whom the pain has been confirmed to be at thelevel of the fracture by physical examination and imaging\".In a 2014 consensus statement,the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), American Association of NeurologicalSurgeons (AANS), Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), American College of Radiology(ACR), American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), American Society of Spin Radiology(ASSR), Canadian Interventional Radiology Association (CIRA), and the Society ofNeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) considered PVA a proven medically appropriate therapyfor treatment of painful VCFs refractory to brief (24 hrs.) nonoperative medical therapy.The2017 Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiologic Society of Europe (CIRSE) guidelinenotes that while the evidence for PVP has been conflicting, based on recent data \"it seemsclear that PVP offers significant pain reduction in patients with acute VCFs after short (<3wks.) failed medical therapy\".A 2018 Cochrane review of 21 trials of PVA for osteoporotic VCF \"does not support a role forvertebroplasty for treating acute or subacute osteoporotic vertebral fractures in routinepractice,\"though its methodology has been criticized.A 2019 systematic review andmeta-analysis by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Task Force724 61641217 2510/10/25, 5:30 PMLCD - Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA) for Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fracture (VCF) (L34106)https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?LCDId=341068/20concluded: \"Vertebroplasty does not work to relieve pain from the fracture, and kyphoplastyshould generally only be done in the context of a placebo-controlled clinical trial\".Basedon the uncertainty of benefit, citing both the recent Cochrane analysis and the VERTOS IVresults, UpToDate recommends reserving PVA\" for patients with incapacitating pain fromacute and subacute VCFs who are unable to taper parenteral opioids or transition to oralopioids within seven days of admission or have intolerable side effects from opioidtherapy\".The benefit of PVA is supported by the significantly higher 5-year mortality risk for VCF inMedicare patients after a decline in utilization.In a recent systematic review of evidence-based guidelines for the management of osteoporotic VCF, three of four guidelinesrecommended PVA.In 2018, a multispecialty expert panel (orthopedic and neurosurgeons,interventional [neuro] radiologists and pain specialists), endorsed vertebral augmentationfor select patients, in a clinical care pathway (developed using the RAND/UCLAAppropriateness Method), based on seven variables (pain duration and evolution, acutefracture by advanced imaging, kyphotic deformity, degree and progression of vertebralheight loss, and impact on daily functioning).Whether subgroups of patients might benefitmore from vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, requires further study. A review of the 14published RCTs that examined the role of VA in osteoporotic VCF concluded: \u201cWhile the RCTdata are conflicting, there are patients with acute fractures causing significant pain anddisability who can derive benefit with respect to improvement in pain outcomes, reduction innarcotic usage and reduced length of hospital stay\u201d.\u00a0In a meta-analysis of 16 studies withmortality as an outcome, eight reported mortality benefit in VA, seven reported no benefit,and one reported mixed results.\u00a0The analysis found that VA provided a 22% mortalitybenefit over NSM at 10 years. However, the authors note the potential for \u201ca strong selectionbias in the selection of healthier patients for VA that was not captured by the analysis.\u201d Theyconclude that VA \u201cremains a controversial treatment\u201d and \u201cshould be offered in carefullyselected patients.\u201dIn summary, the premise of weight-bearing fracture immobilization, to limit pain anddeformity, has prima facie validity on first principles. Superimposed is the recent trendtoward immediate, focused, surgical immobilization, and away from prolonged, generalimmobilization (e.g., casting, bracing, bedrest) and prolonged systemic pain management(e.g., opioid analgesics), particularly in the elderly. The preponderance of evidence (studies,national and society guidelines, systematic reviews, multispecialty panel clinical carepathway, and Medicare claims data) favors consideration of early PVA in select patients(moderate to severe and disabling pain due to acute osteoporotic VCF confirmed by physicalexamination and advanced imaging findings).\u00a0However, in addition to timely fracturetreatment, also warranted is increased emphasis on ensuring the continuum of care, andpreventing medical undertreatment of the overarching systemic disease, of which VCF is asymptom.General InformationAssociated Information2081119106\u00a027282910/10/25, 5:30 PMLCD - Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA) for Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fracture (VCF) (L34106)https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/lcd.aspx?LCDId=341069/20N/ASources of InformationN/ABibliography1.
