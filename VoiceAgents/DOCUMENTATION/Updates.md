# VoiceAgents LangGraph - Implementation Updates

This document tracks incremental updates and improvements to the VoiceAgents system.

## Nov 12th Updates

### Clinical Validation Feedback Implementation

**Files:** `nodes/medication.py`, `nodes/appointment.py`

**Changes:**
- Fixed medication agent to only discuss the specific medication requested by the user, preventing confusion from displaying all patient medications
- Added urgent handling for hypoglycemia detection with immediate escalation and actionable guidance (eat fast-acting carbs, immediate nurse transfer)
- Enhanced triage documentation with detailed probing question framework for fever, severe pain, wound issues, and dizziness
- Medication filtering logic now extracts drug names from user queries and shows only relevant information

**Impact:** Agent responses are more focused and clinically appropriate. Hypoglycemia is now treated as time-sensitive emergency. Clear roadmap for Phase 2 multi-turn probing conversations.

## Nov 5th Updates

### Policy and Safety Framework

**Files:** `policy/`, `docs/Safety_and_Boundaries.md`, `utils/llm_provider.py`

**Changes:**
- Created centralized policy system with global system prompt (`policy/system_behavior.py`)
- Added safety rules defining RED/ORANGE/GREEN triage flags (`policy/safety_rules.json`)
- Implemented agent-specific policies for each agent type (`policy/agents/*.json`)
- All agents now load and log their policies on startup
- Modified LLM provider to automatically inject global system prompt into all LLM calls
- Created comprehensive safety documentation (`docs/Safety_and_Boundaries.md`)

**Impact:** Unified safety boundaries and consistent behavior across all agents. All LLM responses now include safety language automatically.

### Error Handling and Resilience

**Files:** `utils/__init__.py`, `utils/llm_provider.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `safe_call()` decorator for consistent error handling with fallback logging
- Applied decorator to `chat_completion`, `audio_transcribe`, and `say` functions
- Implemented fallback logging to `logs/fallback_log.jsonl` for all API failures
- System gracefully handles LLM, STT, and TTS failures without crashing

**Impact:** System remains usable even when external services fail. All errors are logged for debugging.

---

### Testing and Quality Assurance

**Files:** `tests/test_agents.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`

**Changes:**
- Created simplified regression test suite with 4 essential tests covering workflow completion, routing, and RED flag detection
- Tests verify triage consistency (RED flag detection)
- Tests ensure workflow completion and state consistency
- Added pytest to requirements and testing section to README
- Tests are designed to work with or without LLM access using rule-based fallbacks

**Impact:** Automated tests verify system stability after changes. Tests cover critical triage and routing logic.

### Validation Datasets

**Files:** `validation_datasets/appointment_agent_validation.csv`, `validation_datasets/medication_agent_validation.csv`

**Changes:**
- Added validation datasets for appointment and medication agents
- `appointment_agent_validation.csv`: Contains test cases for appointment operations including status checks, scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation with various patient scenarios
- `medication_agent_validation.csv`: Contains test cases for medication queries including side effects, missed doses, drug interactions, and contraindications
- Both datasets include expected intents, triage classifications, and parsed data for validation
- Compatible with existing agent code structure and data formats

**Impact:** Structured validation datasets enable systematic testing and evaluation of agent performance. Datasets can be used for automated evaluation and quality assurance.

### Logging and Observability

**Files:** `utils/logging_utils.py`

**Changes:**
- Standardized all logs to unified schema: `timestamp`, `agent`, `level`, `message`, `risk`, `context`
- Enhanced existing log functions to normalize entries while maintaining backward compatibility
- Added `write_log()` function for direct structured logging
- All agent logs now parse cleanly with pandas for analytics

**Impact:** Consistent log structure enables easier analysis and auditing. No changes to existing log files.
